## Investigating air quality and PM2.5 concentration during lockdown
**Overview**<br/>
I have tried to explore the air quality and pm2.5 concentration during the covid19 in 2020. Apart from that I have investigated the effect of lockdown on air quality. I have also demonstrated a comparison of pm2.5 concentration in lockdown with that before lockdown.<br/>

Code    : [Notebook](https://github.com/touhid498/Air_Quality_COVID19/blob/master/Notebook/AQI.ipynb) <br/>
<br/>
**Data**<br/>
The dataset is obtained from [Air Quality Historical Data Platform](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register). It contains hourly concentration of AQI and PM2.5 from start of 2020. Original source of data is [US Embassy in Bangladesh](https://bd.usembassy.gov/) <br/>
<br/>
Bar graph for air quality shows a gradual decrease in air pollution<br/>

<br/>
**Results**<br/>
We have explored the PM2.5 concentration during lockdown period and see that the concentration gradualy decreases.

We have compared the PM2.5 concentration before and during lockdown. We can clearly see that during lockdown the concentration is much less which was expected<br/>

**Future**<br/>
In this study we have only exploited PM2.5 and AQI data. We can work with other polluttants as well which whill give us more information.
